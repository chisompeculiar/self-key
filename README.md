# Selfkey: Decentralized Self-Sovereign Identity Management

## Overview
SovID is a blockchain-based identity management platform that empowers users to have complete control over their personal information while enabling selective disclosure of identity attributes.

## Key Features
- Self-sovereign identity creation
- Selective attribute disclosure
- Age verification
- Secure, immutable identity storage
- User-controlled privacy settings

## Smart Contract Functionality
- `create-or-update-identity`: Create or modify user identity
- `get-identity-attributes`: Retrieve specific identity attributes
- `verify-age`: Verify and update age status

## Technologies
- Blockchain: Stacks
- Smart Contract Language: Clarity
- Key Principles: Privacy, User Control, Selective Disclosure

## Use Cases
1. Age verification for services
2. Professional credential sharing
3. Privacy-preserving authentication
4. Secure personal data management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks wallet
- Web3 development environment
- Clarity smart contract development tools

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Deploy smart contract to Stacks testnet/mainnet

## Security Considerations
