# Sovereign Identity Management on Stacks

A comprehensive decentralized identity management system built on the Stacks blockchain, enabling users to create, manage, and verify their digital identities while maintaining full control over their personal information.

## Core Features

- **Decentralized Identity Creation**: Create and manage DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)
- **Claims Management**: Add and verify identity claims
- **Verification System**: Two-tier verification with individual claim verification and overall identity status
- **Privacy Controls**: Selective disclosure through granular claim management
- **Owner-Controlled Updates**: Users maintain full control over their identity attributes
- **Scalable Storage**: Support for multiple claims per identity (up to 10 verified claims)

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Capabilities

- Identity Creation and Management
  - Create new identities with DIDs
  - Update existing DIDs
  - Add and manage identity claims
  
- Verification System
  - Verify individual claims
  - Set overall identity verification status
  - Check verification status of claims and identities

- Data Retrieval
  - Get complete identity information
  - Retrieve all claims for an identity
  - Check verification status
  - Track total number of identities

### Security Features

- Contract owner authorization for sensitive operations
- Input validation for DIDs and claims
- Size limits on claims and identities
- Immutable creation timestamps
- Update tracking through block height

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Stacks Wallet
- Clarity Development Environment
- Basic understanding of DIDs and claims

### Contract Deployment

1. Clone the repository
2. Configure your Stacks wallet
3. Deploy using Clarinet or stacks-cli:
   ```bash
   clarinet deploy identity-management
   ```

### Usage Examples

Create a new identity:
```clarity
(contract-call? .identity-management create-identity "did:stack:1234")
```

Add a claim:
```clarity
(contract-call? .identity-management add-claim "education:degree=bachelor")
```

## Architecture

- **Storage Layer**: Efficient map structures for identities and claims
- **Access Control**: Owner-based authorization system
- **Verification Layer**: Two-tier verification system
- **Query Interface**: Comprehensive read-only functions

## Error Handling

The contract includes specific error codes for various scenarios:
- Invalid authorization
- Duplicate identities
- Non-existent identities
- Invalid claims/DIDs
- Claim verification errors

## Future Enhancements

- Cross-chain identity verification
- Enhanced privacy features through zero-knowledge proofs
- Integration with external identity providers
- Reputation system implementation
- Governance mechanisms for identity verification
